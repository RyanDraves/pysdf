# UM::Autonomy Note
This fork is a lightly modified version of https://github.com/andreasBihlmaier/pysdf. It's adapted to work with our structures of models (works fine out of the box) and our `.world` files, which contain several generated buoy models. A minimal time investment was made into getting this, Gazebo2Rviz, and our Gazebo models/worlds to mesh together.
